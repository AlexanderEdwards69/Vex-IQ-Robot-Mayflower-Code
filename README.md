During my Middle School Robotics were making CLawBots along with another robot that Represnts the Mayflower Ship to set an example for younger kids in our school Districs Elementary School 
This Code is for the Middle School Robotics Project where we build a robot that represents the Mayflower Ship, This Ship will be showned off to kids and also have a sector to deliver kids candy with the robot 

This Code can easily be adapted to both the ClawZBot and Future Creations or other projects if needed.
